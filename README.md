# Data Analytics Learning Projects

This repository contains my practice projects in **data analytics** using Python, SQL, and Excel.  
Although my programming courses at university were short, they inspired me to study analytics further on my own.

## üîß Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- SQL (basic SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY)
- Excel / Power BI (dashboards, reports)

## üìÇ Projects
1. **Sales Analysis (Python)**
   - Dataset: monthly sales
   - Tasks: calculate average & max sales, build a simple line chart
   - File: `sales_analysis.py`

2. **Text Analysis (Python)**
   - Simple script to count word frequency in a text
   - File: `text_analysis.py`

3. **SQL Queries**
   - Join customers with orders
   - Calculate sales per customer
   - Find average order value
   - File: `queries.sql`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run

# source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Run scripts
python sales_analysis.py
python text_analysis.py
```

## üå± Learning Goals
- Improve SQL and Python skills
- Practice data visualization
- Learn product and business analytics tools
